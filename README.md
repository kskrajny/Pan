# Pan

This is a game which some people calls "Pan". Dont know why I have written "Cyfry".
There is a button "Pokaz zasady". If you click, it shows rules. 
Rules:
1. The game starts automatically after selecting the number "0".
2. Players may throw cards with a number such as in the middle or larger.
3. If a player has 4 cards of the same number, he may throw them out at once.
4. The player who gets rid of all cards first wins.

This small game is my first project with JS, HTML and CSS, which I have done juest for fun.
